        <div class="About">
            <p><h4>Heart disease in the modern age (defined largely as the 20th and 21st centuries) represents a unique, "triumphalist" story of a massive health epidemic that rose to dominate mortality, only to be drastically reduced by rapid advancements in medicine and prevention. Once considered a rare or unavoidable "death sentence" in the early 1900s, it became the leading cause of death by the 1920s before beginning a steady decline in the mid-1960s, a trend that continues to evolve. </h4></p>
